### Hi there 👋 I'm Andrew 

ServiceNow Certified Application Developer & System Administrator, specialising in designing, developing and deploying Now platform solutions. My current focus is ServiceNow system configuration and custom application development, with extra responsibility for client engagement and stakeholder management. I have a broader interest in ServiceNow architecture and solutioning, with a longer-term aim of gaining CTA status (recently attained ServiceNow’s new Architecture Excellence (ArchX) accreditation).
